# Smart Garbage System

## Overview
The **Smart Garbage System** is an IoT-based solution designed to optimize garbage collection in urban areas. It uses real-time data sensing with **ESP32** and **IR sensors**, which transmit information to **Firebase** for monitoring and analysis. The system is further enhanced with a **map interface** for displaying smart bins and a **route optimization algorithm** for garbage collection trucks. Additionally, data analytics, such as fill levels of bins across different areas, are presented through visual charts generated by **Matplotlib**.

The **web application** is built with **Next.js** and provides an interactive map interface to visualize the garbage collection process. The **Figma design** offers a clear vision of the future development of the app, which includes additional features like user notifications, different login types, and a user-friendly dashboard.

## Features
- **IoT Integration**: Uses **ESP32** and **IR sensors** to sense real-time data and send it to **Firebase**.
- **Route Optimization**: A **heuristic algorithm** is used to find the optimal route for garbage collection trucks, ensuring efficient garbage collection.
- **Map Interface**: The web application displays smart bins and their fill levels, along with the optimized routes for trucks.
- **Analytics**: Visual charts generated using **Matplotlib** show the fill levels of bins in various areas.
- **User Notifications**: Different levels of notifications are implemented to alert users when garbage collectors arrive at their doorsteps (strong notification within 1km radius and gentle notifications).
- **User Authentication**: Multiple login types are implemented, including **Private Garbage Collectors**, **User Login**, **Government Login**, and **Admin Login**.
- **Figma Design**: A detailed design of how the web app will evolve with additional features.

## Technologies Used
- **Embedded C** for IoT device programming (ESP32 with IR sensors).
- **Firebase** for data storage and real-time updates.
- **Next.js** for the frontend map interface.
- **Heuristic Algorithm** for garbage truck route optimization.
- **Matplotlib** (Python) for generating analytics charts.
- **Figma** for UI/UX design and future feature visualization.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aayishajalal/smart-garbage-system.git
cd smart-garbage-system
```

### 2. Setting Up the IoT Device (ESP32)
Install the required drivers for ESP32.
Upload the embedded C code to the ESP32 board.
Ensure the IR sensors are connected to the board for sensing data.
Configure Firebase to store the data received from the IoT devices.

### 3. Frontend Setup (Next.js)
Install dependencies:
``` bash
npm install
```
Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Python Analytics (Matplotlib)
Install required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
Run the analytics script to generate the fill-level charts.

### 5. User Interface & Notifications
The Figma design shows the visualized future version of the application. It includes the notification system for users, private collectors, and different login roles.
Future Features
Notification System: Implement strong notifications when garbage collectors arrive at a user's doorstep (within 1km radius).
Login System: Develop separate logins for users, private collectors, government officials, and admin.
Enhanced Data Analytics: Additional insights on garbage collection trends and route optimization.
